*change-hash-syntax.txt*                        change-hash-syntax


This plugin changes Ruby hash syntax to 1.9
:key => "value" become key: "value"


                                                *ChangeHashSyntax*

To change hash syntax, just call :ChangeHashSyntax.  By default it
operates on the entire file.  Pass a range (or use V to select some lines)
to restrict the portion of the file that gets fixed.
